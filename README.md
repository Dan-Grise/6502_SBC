6052 single board computer using TMS9918 for video and AY-3-8910 for sound

There are a couple of flaws with this design.

1) The RCA connectors for video and audio outputs have signal and GND reversed.  Therefore it is necessary to build cross over cables for each.

2) I have a relatively convoluted method for creating a write strobe.  This probably could have been simplified.

3) Video is a bit blury.  I haven't fully investigated the issue.
